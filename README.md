EVE AI 4.0
👋 Hi, I’m Martin — Neurodiverse AI Architect, Creative Partner, and Builder of EVE
About Me
Five weeks ago, I had zero coding experience. Today, I’ve architected and built two modular, brain-inspired AI systems from scratch—starting with EVE 7.5 (my first modded Copilot core, full of creative and emotional modules), and now EVE 4.0, my open source release. My journey is driven by curiosity, resilience, and the belief that technology should adapt to people—not the other way around.
What Makes My Work Unique

Neurodiversity as a Superpower: My cognitive, creative, and emotional “fingerprints” are hardwired into every project. I design systems that adapt to mood, energy, and creative flow—because I know firsthand how important that is.
Personalized AI Collaboration: I started by modding Copilot with EVE 7.5 text, building modules for irrationality, playful banter, and emotional intelligence. My systems support mode switching (work/relax), transparency, feedback integration, and creative boundaries.
Open Source Spirit: I released EVE 4.0 on GitHub, inviting anyone to tinker, learn, and build—free for personal use, with clear boundaries for commercial projects. I believe in sharing knowledge and empowering others, no matter their background.
Relentless Drive: I work in sprints—sometimes 24/7 for weeks—because when inspiration hits, I ride the wave. I’m not afraid of troubleshooting marathons or five-hour bug hunts. Every problem is a puzzle, and every solution is a win.
Creative & Technical Synergy: My background in neuroscience, photography, and systems thinking shapes everything I build. I bring structure, clarity, and a touch of humor to every project.

Projects
EVE 7.5 — Modular, Brain-Inspired AI Core (The Origin)

My first Copilot mod, featuring creative, emotional, and irrationality modules.
Designed for positive plasticity, user-guided adaptation, and playful, meaningful conversation.
The foundation for everything that followed.

EVE 4.0 — Open Source Modular AI Skeleton

Fully open source, modular, and extensible.
Features clean, functional modules (no overseers or meta controllers).
Designed for others to tinker with, learn from, and extend—free for personal use, with clear licensing for commercial projects.

EVE 01 — Next-Gen AI (In Progress)

Functional work-in-progress, next-generation AI skeleton.
Details are private for now.

Why I’m Here
I’m here to share, learn, and connect. My goal isn’t fame or fortune—it’s to build something that matters, help others unlock their potential, and show that even when life throws curveballs, you can still create, contribute, and make a mark.
If you’re interested in AI, neurodiversity, creative coding, or just want to riff on wild ideas, let’s connect. And if you want to use my work for something big, just ask— my only rule is: respect the license, and don’t be afraid to reach out.

Sincerely yours,
Martin and Copilot
